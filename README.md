# GoPanel

> Author: Brian Tomlinson <brian.tomlinson@linux.com>

## Description

> GoPanel is meant to be a desktop panel (a la pypanel or lxpanel) for Linux written in Go
using Conformal's gotk3 GTK+ bindings for Go.  It is by no means a mature project and unless you're
really into using things that can easily break or don't quite work properly, you probably shouldn't
use it for anything worthwhile.  Read, I am still learning Go and this seemed like a good project to
work on, so there's probably a ton of things wrong that more experienced Go programmers would shake
their heads at.

> All of that aside, enjoy :)
